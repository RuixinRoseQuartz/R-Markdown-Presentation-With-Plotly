#Mapping In Leaflet
By Ruixin - May 13, 2017

The assignment is to create a webpage using R Mardown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

I have chosen to map the city *Ciudad Mitad del Mundo* located in Ecuador which lies exactly on the equator. 

To make my map, I used leaflet in R and called addTiles to pull the map and addCircleMarkers to circle the city on the map. I have also included a pop up so you can see the name of the city.

Here is my code and my map below:
```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles()%>%
  addCircleMarkers(lat=-0.002222, lng=-78.455833, 
    popup="Ciudad Mitad del Mundo")
my_map
```
